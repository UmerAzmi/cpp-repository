# Part-4 — C++ SDE Questions

A collection of C++ interview-style questions and solutions designed to strengthen problem-solving skills and mastery of core software development concepts.

## Overview

This project contains multiple C++ problems representative of technical interview scenarios for Software Development Engineer roles. Each implementation focuses on efficient algorithms, structured design, and practical application of C++ features, including data structures and object-oriented principles.

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)

## How to Run

1. Ensure a C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) is installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmerAzmi/part-4.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd part-4
```

4. Compile the desired C++ file:

```bash
g++ question1.cpp -o question1
```

5. Run the executable:

```bash
./question1
```

(On Windows, run `question1.exe`.)

## Notes

* Each file corresponds to a specific interview-style problem.
* Solutions emphasize correctness, efficiency, and clarity.
* Designed for focused practice and interview preparation.

## How to Clone
