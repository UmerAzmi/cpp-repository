# Part-2 — C++ SDE Questions

A collection of C++ solutions to Software Development Engineer (SDE) interview-style questions, focused on algorithmic problem-solving and effective use of core C++ features.

## Overview

This project contains implementations that address technical interview scenarios using C++. It emphasizes clean coding practices, efficient algorithms, and practical application of data structures and object-oriented design principles.

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* Common competitive programming header `<bits/stdc++.h>`

## How to Run

1. Ensure a C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) is installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmerAzmi/part-2.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd part-2
```

4. Compile the program:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o solution
```

5. Run the executable:

```bash
./solution
```

(On Windows, run `solution.exe`.)

## Notes

* Some implementations use `<bits/stdc++.h>` for concise access to standard library components.
* Focused on interview preparation and advanced problem-solving practice.
* Code is structured for clarity, efficiency, and adaptability.

## How to Clone
