# Part-1 — C++ SDE Questions

A collection of C++ solutions to Software Development Engineer (SDE)-level questions, focused on strengthening problem-solving skills and mastery of core C++ concepts.

## Overview

This project contains C++ code implementations addressing a variety of technical interview-style problems. It serves as a structured resource for practicing algorithmic thinking, coding efficiency, and effective use of the C++ Standard Library.

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)

## How to Run

1. Ensure a C++ compiler is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` file.
4. Compile the program:

```bash
g++ file_name.cpp -o output
```

5. Run the executable:

```bash
./output
```

(On Windows, run `output.exe`.)

## Notes

* Some files include `<bits/stdc++.h>` for convenient access to standard library components.
* Designed for interview preparation and advanced C++ practice.
* Emphasizes clean implementation and efficient solutions.

## How to Clone

```bash
