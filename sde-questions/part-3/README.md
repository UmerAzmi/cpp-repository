# Part-3 — C++ SDE Questions

A collection of C++ solutions to Software Development Engineer (SDE) interview-style problems, emphasizing efficient algorithms, data structures, and advanced C++ techniques.

## Overview

This project contains multiple C++ implementations that address a range of technical interview challenges. The solutions focus on performance, correctness, and clear use of language features, including bit manipulation and STL-based approaches.

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* Bit manipulation techniques (e.g., `<bitset>`)
* Common competitive programming header `<bits/stdc++.h>`

## How to Run

1. Ensure a C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) is installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmerAzmi/part-3.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd part-3
```

4. Compile the desired C++ file:

```bash
g++ yourfile.cpp -o yourfile
```

5. Run the executable:

```bash
./yourfile
```

(On Windows, run `yourfile.exe`.)

## Notes

* Solutions leverage STL containers and algorithms for efficiency.
* Some implementations use `<bits/stdc++.h>` for concise access to standard headers.
* Designed for interview preparation and advanced problem-solving practice.

## How to Clone
