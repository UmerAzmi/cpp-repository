# C++ SDE Questions

A curated collection of C++ solutions to Software Development Engineer (SDE) interview-level problems, organized into multiple parts for structured practice and progression.

## Overview

This repository serves as the central collection for C++ implementations of technical interview questions. Each subdirectory (Part-1, Part-2, Part-3, Part-4, etc.) focuses on a set of problems that emphasize algorithmic thinking, efficient data structures, and effective use of modern C++ features.

## Repository Structure

* **Part-1** — Foundational interview problems and techniques
* **Part-2** — Intermediate algorithmic challenges
* **Part-3** — Advanced problem-solving and optimization
* **Part-4** — Additional interview scenarios and patterns

Each part contains standalone C++ implementations that can be compiled and executed independently.

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* Bit manipulation techniques
* Competitive programming header `<bits/stdc++.h>`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmerAzmi/cpp-repository.git
cd cpp-repository/sde-questions
```

2. Navigate to the desired part (example):

```bash
cd part-1
```

3. Compile and run the target C++ file:

```bash
g++ yourfile.cpp -o yourfile
./yourfile
```

(On Windows, run `yourfile.exe`.)

## Notes

* Each part contains independent implementations of interview-style problems.
* Solutions prioritize correctness, efficiency, and clarity.
* Designed for interview preparation and advanced C++ practice.
