# DSA (C++)

A collection of C++ implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, created for learning, reference, and problem-solving practice.

## Overview

This repository contains C++ code covering core data structures and algorithmic concepts. It serves as a hands-on resource for strengthening problem-solving skills and understanding of efficient algorithm design using C++.

Topics covered include:

* Arrays and data manipulation
* Sorting and searching algorithms
* Recursion and iterative techniques
* Standard Template Library (STL) usage
* Algorithmic problem-solving patterns

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)

## How to Run

1. Clone the main repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmerAzmi/cpp-repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the DSA directory:

```bash
cd cpp-repository/dsa
```

3. Compile and run a specific C++ file (example):

```bash
g++ example.cpp -o example
./example
```

(On Windows, run `example.exe`.)

## Notes

* Ensure a C++ compiler (such as `g++`) is installed.
* Programs use features from modern C++ standards and the STL.
* Designed as a reference and implementation repository for core algorithmic concepts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can add new implementations, improve existing solutions, or enhance documentation.
