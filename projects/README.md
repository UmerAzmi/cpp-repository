# C++ Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of console-based C++ projects built for practice and learning core programming concepts. The focus of these projects is clean logic, simple structure, and solid understanding of fundamentals rather than heavy frameworks.

Each project is self-contained and can be compiled and run from the terminal.

## Projects Included

* Number Guessing Game
* Simple Calculator
* Student Record Manager
* Snake Lite (Console Game)
* Dodge the Blocks

## How to Run Any Project

1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Compile using g++.
3. Run the generated executable.

Example:

g++ main.cpp -o app
./app

## Goals of This Repository

* Practice core C++ fundamentals
* Build small but complete console applications
* Improve problem-solving and logic building
* Maintain clean and readable code structure

## Tech Used

* C++
* Standard Library (STL)
* Console I/O
