# C++ Repository

A comprehensive collection of C++ implementations, practice problems, and projects covering data structures, algorithms, interview preparation, and application development.

## Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for C++ learning and development. It contains multiple subdirectories, each focused on a specific area such as algorithmic practice, interview-style problems, or standalone projects.

The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, deepen understanding of core C++ concepts, and develop practical programming experience.

## Repository Structure

* **dsa/** — Implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms
* **sde-questions/** — Interview-style problems organized into multiple parts
* **projects/** — Standalone C++ applications and games

Each folder contains independent programs that can be compiled and executed separately.

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* Console-based input/output
* Algorithmic problem-solving techniques
* Game logic and control systems (in applicable projects)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmerAzmi/cpp-repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cpp-repository
```

3. Enter the desired subfolder (example):

```bash
cd dsa
```

4. Compile and run a specific C++ file:

```bash
g++ file_name.cpp -o program
./program
```

(On Windows, run `program.exe`.)

## Notes

* Each subdirectory represents an independent module or collection of programs.
* Programs rely on modern C++ features and the Standard Template Library.
* Designed for learning, interview preparation, and practical application development.
